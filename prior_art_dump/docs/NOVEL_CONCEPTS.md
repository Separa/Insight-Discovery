# Novel Concepts Disclosed

The Platform introduces a constellation of techniques that, in combination,
form a **self‑adapting, specialist‑orchestrated LLM ecosystem**.  
Each section states a concise invention statement, implementation sketch, and
differentiating elements versus conventional practice.

## 1. Adaptive Routing Adapter  
**Invention Statement:** A lightweight, *PEFT‑trained* adapter that maps incoming
user queries to the most suitable specialist model. The adapter **continually
re‑trains on live routing feedback** and is hot‑swappable without stopping the
orchestrator.  
**Novelty Factors**
- Online reinforcement from reroute events and user ratings.  
- Toggle switch (`--no‑router`) allows A/B comparison.  
- Dataset automatically curated by logging disagreement cases.

## 2. Insight Discovery Loop  
**Invention Statement:** A meta‑specialist scans cross‑specialist logs to surface
**high‑value intersections** (e.g., “NLP + Materials‑Science → battery patent ideas”),
forwarding them to a curator that converts insights into publishable artefacts.  
**Novelty Factors**
- Continuous loop; no human prompt required.  
- Pluggable *revenue‑specialist* for downstream productisation.

## 3. Adaptive Prioritisation for Context Compression  
**Invention Statement:** Scheduler monitors the **latent risk** of postponing
heavy summarisation / compression jobs. When predicted cost‑of‑deferral >
cost‑of‑execution, it elevates compression priority, preventing future
degradation.  
**Novelty Factors**
- Risk model fed by queue depth + memory footprint + SLA proximity.  
- Works in fully offline (air‑gapped) mode.

## 4. Buffered‑Data Re‑integration after Rollback  
**Invention Statement:** Post‑rollback analyser classifies buffered records into
*retain / discard / human‑review*, merging safe data back into live stores.  
**Novelty Factors**
- Uses trust‑weighted hashes to avoid re‑introducing corruption.  
- Rule‑set extendable by meta‑specialist dramaturgy.

## 5. Specialist Lifecycle Manager  
**Invention Statement:** Service tracks **age, usage, & performance** stats for each
specialist, triggering retrain, retirement, or fork events per policy.  
**Novelty Factors**
- *Fork SLA*: auto‑fork after N benchmark failures within M days.  
- Lineage preserved for audit & regression replay.

## 6. Dynamic GGUF Hot‑Swapping  
**Invention Statement:** Orchestrator recognises **variant metadata** inside GGUF
headers and can swap quantised models at runtime with zero downtime.  
**Novelty Factors**
- Variant‑aware routing ensures calls receive compatible context windows.  
- Uses staged GPU copy+atomic pointer swap to avoid memory spikes.

## 7. Redundancy + Specialist Voting  
**Invention Statement:** Query can fan‑out to multiple specialists; a
**trust‑table‑weighted vote** selects the canonical answer, optionally sending dissent
to curator for future training.  
**Novelty Factors**
- Combines trust score, recency, and cost heuristics.  
- Falls back to ADR (architectural decision record) arbitration.

## 8. User‑Specific Experts  
**Invention Statement:** On‑demand specialists fine‑tuned to an individual user’s
private corpus, **checkpointed & pooled** to reclaim VRAM.  
**Novelty Factors**
- Cold‑storage in safetensors, hot‑swap to 8‑bit GPU memory on use.  
- “User‑as‑System‑Node” flag feeds behaviour back into global optimisation.

## 9. GDPR / CCPA Purge with Hash Ledger  
**Invention Statement:** Compliance routine drops vector embeddings & logs tied to
hashed user IDs, recording *forget* transactions in an append‑only ledger.  
**Novelty Factors**
- Purgeable vectors while preserving audit trail integrity.  
- Ledger doubles as provenance proof for future legal requests.

## 10. Snapshot + Diff Logger on Encrypted SSD  
**Invention Statement:** Local 500 GB SSD stores periodic **binary snapshots +
semantic diffs** of models & configs. Change‑size detection chooses block‑level vs
file‑level backup to minimise wear.  
**Novelty Factors**
- Integrated with Windows BitLocker; snapshots verifiable offline.  
- Diff visualiser replays model states for regression testing.

## 11. External Validation Bridge  
**Invention Statement:** Designated agents may call **trusted external APIs** to
verify claims, breaking potential echo‑chambers while respecting air‑gap mode.  
**Novelty Factors**
- RBAC plugin registry restricts which agent can reach which API.  
- Verifier Specialist cross‑checks external assertion consistency.

## 12. Self‑Scaling Evaluation Framework (Architect Advisor)  
**Invention Statement:** Background agent benchmarks specialist output quality,
cost, and latency, and **recommends model‑role re‑assignment** without
downtime.  
**Novelty Factors**
- Dynamic preference matrix selects best model per specialist role.  
- Benchmark harness pluggable for local or HPC cluster (Talapas) runs.
